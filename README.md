# Python-programs-for-MATLAB-in-built-functions
'''This package includes several python programs for doing the correct conversion of MATLAB in-built functions to python.
First one is "im2col" and "col2im" for block size 16 i.e. [16, 16]'''

 col_mtx = im2col(image, blk_size)
 
 res_img = col2im(col_mtx, image, blk_size)
